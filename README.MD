# Description of the project
Programme to parse a collection of traditional irish tunes from abc notation, to then extract the meaningful data and allow the user to query said data with a (limited) interactive terminal based menu 
# Instructions for use

# How it works:

# List of files in the project

| Files | Source |
|-----------|-----------|
| main.py | Self written (fine tuned using AI)||

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

Having a working product at the end and also learning how parsing works as well as git commands.

# What I learned
Parsing, and how its used to make data readable for python, lab 5 syntax very useful for this, however struggled with parsing the most

use of AI assisted coding, gpt can access repositories to supply relevant code from past labs

github- hard reset vs soft reset (learned that the hard way), reset to an early commit, got lucky that copilot remembered most of what i wrote.
also learned how to use manual commands for github and how useful they are for debugging

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
